We are looking for a passionate developer to join a young technology startup in the logistics sector. The successful candidate will have the chance to join an exciting, innovative and fast growing company. 

The demand for delivery services is growing around the world. The size of this market is huge and will continue to grow in the coming years. At the same time the delivery offers are becoming more complex and diverse. To face this increase in complexity and to reduce inner city congestion, URBANTZ provides a solution to better organise and simplify the last mile delivery business. URBANTZ believes in the performance of its network of senders and delivery platforms. We’re setting-up a global collaborative network connecting all the logistics actors so that they can easily scale-up their activities.

Think, code and code. Think again and then code some more. Take a coffee and refactor the whole thing. Then have a great idea and make it twice as fast. Go home and read about some new tech that could help us with this or that. Come back the next day and tell the team about it. Try things out, see if it sticks, suggest changes. Help us build the best solution out there.
